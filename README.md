# TuneInPowerShell
A simple TuneIn Radio script for PowerShell, demonstrating the use of the TuneIn API and media playback via .Net

The script uses Microsoft's .Net PresentationFoundation and thus requires Windows PowerShell to run. It currently is not compatible with PowerShell 6+.
It is currently very basic and is intended mainly as a proof of concept rather than a daily-use tool, it will contain bugs.

Instructions for use are contained within the script and given upon runtime.
